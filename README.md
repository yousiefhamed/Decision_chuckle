# DecisionChukle - Serious Risk, Seriously fun ðŸ˜‚

DecisionChukle is a simple Python application for decision-making under uncertainty. It provides various criteria for solving decision-making problems and allows users to input their preferences and decision matrices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes with Python installation)

## Usage

1. Run the script `python DecisionChukle.py`.
2. Enter the required information, such as the number of alternatives, number of state of natures, and your preferred criteria.
3. Click on "Let's Have Fun ðŸ˜„" to input the decision matrix.
4. Follow the prompts to enter decision matrix values and additional information based on the chosen criteria.
5. View the result, which will display the best alternative based on the chosen criteria.

## Criteria

The application supports the following decision criteria:

- Maximax (optimistic)
- Maximin (pessimistic)
- Criterion of Realism (Hurwicz)
- Equally Likely (Laplace)
- Minimax Regret

## Features

- Interactive GUI using Tkinter
- Dynamic input for decision matrix
- Multiple decision criteria options

## Example

Here's an example of using the application:

1. Enter the number of state of natures: 3
2. Enter the number of alternatives: 4
3. Choose your preferred criteria: Maximax
4. Input the decision matrix values when prompted.
5. View the result showing the best alternative based on the Maximax criteria.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

## Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

   - Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to your preferred location.

2. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:**

     ```bash
     cd path/to/decision-chukle
     ```

4. **Install Required Modules (If Needed):**

   - If your system does not have the required modules (`tkinter` is usually included with Python), you may need to install them using:

     ```

6. **Interact with the Application:**

   - The GUI window of the DecisionChukle application should open.
   - Enter the required information such as the number of alternatives, number of state of natures, preferred criteria, etc., and click the "Let's Have Fun ðŸ˜„" button.
   - Follow the prompts to provide necessary inputs and view the results.

7. **Enjoy Decision Making Under Uncertainty!**

Note: Ensure that you have the correct permissions to execute Python scripts on your system.
